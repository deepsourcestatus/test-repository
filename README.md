# monitors-test-repo

This repository is used as a test repository for monitoring various workflows.

Use reference-branch as the branch that contains analysis-worthy changes. Always fork a branch from reference-branch to test-branch, and create PRs from test-branch to main. test-branch is supposed to be ephemeral, but reference-branch must be persistent.
